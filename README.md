# SuperModels

SuperModels is an open-source project running multiple LLM APIs in one desktop app. 

Stack: Python, Node.js Electron, and Tailwindcss for styling.

## Value prop: lightweight Agent Workflows

The real magic happens here: the [dispatcher](https://github.com/JohannesVC/supermodels/tree/master/python/dispatch). 

The Python does the interactions with the APIs. 

It also allows for `agentic workflows`. 

The agent can write and execute code, and use Perplexity AI's excellent online LLMs.


*All without using Langchain or other sprawling API wrappers.
