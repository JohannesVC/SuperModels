# *`__SuperModels`*

SuperModels is an open-source project for running multiple LLM APIs in one desktop app.

## *purpose*: 

`A self-reflecting machine:` 

- Think Wittgenstein not Frankenstein
- Built-in reflection mechanism to steer *thinking*
- Fully customisable

*__in short*
`A lightweight, simple, and easy to adapt Agent.`

Stack: `Python`, `Electronjs`, and `TailwindCSS`.

## *walk-through:*

#### 1. SuperModel
- [Groq](https://groq.com/) is faster than any other inference engine as it uses "LPUs". It supports JSON mode and Tool use. 

#### 2. ToolUser
- Python is generated by the `python_wizzard` tool. 
  *Note that running generated code is not without risk. - Be prepared for SuperModels to take control over your OS and start operating your home automation.*
- A second tool is Perplexity AI's `online_llm`. 

#### 3. Agent
The **real magic** happens [here (click for source code)](https://github.com/JohannesVC/supermodels/tree/master/python/dispatch/_agent): 

1. The agent breaks down complex problems into steps:
```python
self._break_down = BreakdownReflection(prompt, model=self._model)
...
```
2. Every step is passed to the tooluser:
```python
for step in break_down_call.steps:
    self._answer = self._tooluser.call(step)
```
3. The tooluser's answer is fed back into the model:
```python
new_prompt = "Let's take a moment to consider."
            + "We just tried to answer: \n"
            + step + "\n\n"
            + "This as part of: \n"
            + f"- {"\n- ".join(step for step in break_down_call.steps)} \n\n"
            + f"This to answer the original question: {prompt}."
         
self._should_continue = YesNoReflection(new_prompt, self._answer, model=self._model)
```
4. The agent is then forced into a yes or no reflection:
```python
reflection:YesOrNo = self._should_continue.call()

if reflection.userInputRequired:
    ...
elif reflection.answer: 
    ...
```
`The combination of a super fast tooluser and nominally typed answers allows for quite impressive reflections and reasoning.` Although I still haven't got it to turn the lights off.
